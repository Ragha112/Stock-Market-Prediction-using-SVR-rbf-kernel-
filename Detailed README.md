# üìà Stock Market Prediction using Support Vector Regression (SVR) with RBF Kernel

This project applies **Machine Learning techniques (SVR with RBF kernel)** to forecast the stock prices of **Apple (AAPL)** and **Microsoft (MSFT)** using **5 years of historical data**.  
It integrates **technical indicators** and **hyperparameter tuning** to enhance prediction accuracy and model generalization.

## üß† Objective
To build a regression model capable of predicting **future closing prices** of major tech stocks by capturing nonlinear market trends using **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**.

## üìä Dataset
- **Source:** [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com) (via `yfinance` API)
- **Stocks Used:** AAPL (Apple) and MSFT (Microsoft)
- **Time Period:** 2018‚Äì2023 (5 years)
- **Frequency:** Daily closing prices

## üß© Methodology

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Collection
Data was fetched using the `yfinance` library for both Apple and Microsoft tickers.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Engineering
- Calculated **EMA-14 (Exponential Moving Average)** to smooth out short-term fluctuations.  
- Normalized data using `StandardScaler` for SVR training.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Model Selection
- Used **Support Vector Regression (SVR)** with **RBF kernel** to capture nonlinear price patterns.  
- The RBF kernel helps model complex relationships between past and current prices.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Hyperparameter Tuning
Applied **GridSearchCV** to optimize parameters:
```python
parameters = {
    'C': [1, 10, 100],
    'gamma': [0.01, 0.1, 1],
    'epsilon': [0.01, 0.1, 1]
}
